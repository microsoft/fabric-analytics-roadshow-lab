    "# Welcome to the Fabric Analytics Roadshow Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Welcome to the **McMillan Industrial Group** analytics transformation journey! In this lab, you'll build a modern, streaming-enabled data lakehouse using Microsoft Fabric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Business Scenario\n",
    "McMillan Industrial Group is a leading manufacturer and distributor of industrial equipment and parts. Their systems generate real-time data from:\n",
    "- 👥 **Customers** - Customer master data and profiles\n",
    "- 📝 **Orders** - Sales orders placed online and manually\n",
    "- ⚙️ **Items** - Item master data\n",
    "- 📦 **Shipments** - Outbound shipments and delivery tracking\n",
    "- 📱 **Shipment Scan Events** - Real-time package scanning from field technicians and warehouse systems\n",
    "- 🚚 **Logistics Dimensions** - Facilities, routes, shipping methods, service level, and exception type\n",
    "\n",
    "This data streams continuously into OneLake in various formats (JSON, Parquet), and your mission is to transform raw data into actionable business intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture: Medallion Pattern\n",
    "We'll implement a **medallion architecture** - a common practice for organizing data based on the level of data refinement and readiness for end-user consumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ℹ️ _Note: similar streaming scenarios ideally leverage Azure Event Hubs or Fabric EventStreams to store events in a message store that manages sequence and provides a simple consumption endpoint. The same JSON payloads could be coming from either of these message stores, however for simplicity of reproducing the use case, we will be reading events as files stored in OneLake._\n",

    "### What Happens Next\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spark Job Definition you just triggered will:\n",
    "- 🎲 **Generate synthetic data** simulating McMillan's business operations\n",
    "- 📝 **Write JSON and Parquet files** to the Landing zone (folder) of your Lakehouse\n",
    "- ⚡ **Stream data** from Landing → Bronze → Silver zones\n",
    "- 🔄 **Run continuously** for the duration of this lab\n",
    "\n",
    "> ℹ️ **Important:** The job runs in the background. You don't need to wait for it to complete - you can start working through this notebook immediately. The job should take approximately 1.5 minutes to start writing data to `Files/landing/` and another 2-3 minutes for all bronze and silver tables to be initially created and hydrated with data.\n",

    "- Register JSON files as a SQL table (exists only for this session)\n",
    "- Query file-based data as if it were a database table\n",
    "- Express additional options like `multiLine` JSON configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Exploding Nested Arrays** _(you'll write this query!)_\n",
    "- The shipment JSON contains an **array** of shipment records\n",
    "- Use `EXPLODE()` to transform arrays into individual rows\n",
    "- Use `*` to expand all columns from nested structs into flat columns\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **Why This Matters:** While many data engineers prefer the PySpark DataFrame API, Spark supports SQL too (SparkSQL). It's often easier to express complex business logic in SQL - there's no need to compromise, work in the language that you are most comfortable with! \n",

    "## 🌊 Part 2: Why Structured Streaming?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structured Streaming** is Spark's powerful engine for processing data streams, but it's useful far beyond just real-time, low-latency scenarios. Here's why it's commonly used in modern data engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Built-in Incremental Processing**\n",
    "   - Automatically tracks which data has been processed\n",
    "   - Only processes new/changed files since the last run\n",
    "   - No need to manually manage watermarks or state\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exactly-Once Semantics**\n",
    "   - Guarantees each record is processed exactly once\n",
    "   - Prevents duplicate data in your Delta tables\n",
    "   - Handles failures gracefully with automatic recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fault Tolerance**\n",
    "   - Checkpointing saves progress automatically\n",
    "   - If a job fails, it resumes from the last checkpoint\n",
    "   - No data loss or reprocessing of already-handled records\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unified API**\n",
    "   - Same DataFrame API for batch and streaming\n",
    "   - Write once, run in batch or streaming mode\n",
    "   - Easy to prototype in batch, deploy as streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimized for Delta Lake**\n",
    "   - Native integration with Delta tables\n",
    "   - Handles schema evolution automatically\n",
    "   - Enables time travel and data versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💼 Common Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ETL Pipelines**: Continuously ingest and transform data as it arrives\n",
    "- **Data Lakehouse**: Build incremental Bronze → Silver → Gold pipelines\n",
    "- **Real-time Analytics**: Power dashboards with up-to-the-minute data\n",
    "- **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Process CDC data from source systems\n",
    "- **Event Processing**: Handle IoT sensors, clickstreams, logs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ Architecture in This Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "In our medallion architecture, Structured Streaming powers:\n",
    "- **Landing → Bronze**: Ingesting raw JSON/Parquet files with audit metadata and column renaming (snake case)\n",
    "- **Bronze → Silver**: Flattening nested structures, applying business rules, data quality checks\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the data arrives as files in OneLake (not a traditional message store), Structured Streaming gives us:\n",
    "- Incremental processing (only new files)\n",
    "- Exactly-once guarantees (no duplicates)\n",
    "- Automatic restart capability (fault tolerance)\n",

    "| Component | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Input Source** | Where data comes from (files, Kafka, Event Hubs, etc.) |\n",

    "| **Checkpointing** | Tracks progress for exactly-once processing and fault tolerance |\n",
    "| **Trigger Intervals** | How often to process new data (continuous, fixed interval, available now) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 The Streaming Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Read stream from source\n",
    "df = spark.readStream.format(\"json\").load(\"path/to/input\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Apply transformations (same as batch!)\n",
    "transformed = df.select(...).where(...).withColumn(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Write to Delta Lake\n",
