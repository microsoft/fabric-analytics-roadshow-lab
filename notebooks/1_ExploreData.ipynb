    "# 🚀 Welcome to the Fabric Analytics Roadshow Lab!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Welcome to the **McMillan Industrial Group** analytics transformation journey! In this lab, you'll build a modern, streaming-enabled data lakehouse using Microsoft Fabric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Business Scenario\n",
    "McMillan Industrial Group is a leading manufacturer and distributor of industrial equipment and parts. Their systems generate real-time data from:\n",
    "- 👥 **Customers** - Customer master data and profiles\n",
    "- 📝 **Orders** - Sales orders placed online and manually\n",
    "- 📦 **Items** - Item master data\n",
    "- 🚚 **Shipments** - Outbound shipments and delivery tracking\n",
    "- 📱 **Shipment Scan Events** - Real-time package scanning from field technicians and warehouse systems\n",
    "- 🌐 **Logistics Dimensions** - Facilities, routes, shipping methods, service level, and exception type\n",
    "\n",
    "This data streams continuously into OneLake in various formats (JSON, Parquet), and your mission is to transform raw data into actionable business intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture: Medallion Pattern\n",
    "We'll implement a **medallion architecture** - a common practice for organizing data based on the level of data refinement and readiness for end-user consumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ℹ️ _Note: similar streaming scenarios ideally leverage Azure Event Hubs or Fabric EventStreams to store events in a message store that manages sequence and provides a simple consumption endpoint. The same JSON payloads could be coming from either of these message stores, however for simplicity of reproducing the use case, we will be reading events as files stored in OneLake._\n",

    "    ↓ Spark - Structured Streaming\n",
    "🥉 BRONZE Zone - Raw ingestion with audit columns and column name cleaning\n",

The job should take ~ 1.5 minutes to start writing data to `Files/landing/` and another 2-3 minutes for all bronze and silver tables to be intially created and hydrated with data.\n",

    "## 🌊 Part 2: Why Structured Streaming?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structured Streaming** is Spark's powerful engine for processing data streams, but it's useful far beyond just real-time, low-latency scenarios. Here's why it's commonly used in modern data engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **✅ Built-in Incremental Processing**\n",
    "   - Automatically tracks which data has been processed\n",
    "   - Only processes new/changed files since the last run\n",
    "   - No need to manually manage watermarks or state\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **✅ Exactly-Once Semantics**\n",
    "   - Guarantees each record is processed exactly once\n",
    "   - Prevents duplicate data in your Delta tables\n",
    "   - Handles failures gracefully with automatic recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **✅ Fault Tolerance**\n",
    "   - Checkpointing saves progress automatically\n",
    "   - If a job fails, it resumes from the last checkpoint\n",
    "   - No data loss or reprocessing of already-handled records\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **✅ Unified API**\n",
    "   - Same DataFrame API for batch and streaming\n",
    "   - Write once, run in batch or streaming mode\n",
    "   - Easy to prototype in batch, deploy as streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **✅ Optimized for Delta Lake**\n",
    "   - Native integration with Delta tables\n",
    "   - Handles schema evolution automatically\n",
    "   - Enables time travel and data versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💼 Common Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ETL Pipelines**: Continuously ingest and transform data as it arrives\n",
    "- **Data Lakehouse**: Build incremental Bronze → Silver → Gold pipelines\n",
    "- **Real-time Analytics**: Power dashboards with up-to-the-minute data\n",
    "- **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Process CDC data from source systems\n",
    "- **Event Processing**: Handle IoT sensors, clickstreams, logs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ Architecture in This Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "In our medallion architecture, Structured Streaming powers:\n",
    "- **Landing → Bronze**: Ingesting raw JSON/Parquet files with audit metadata and column renaming (snake case)\n",
    "- **Bronze → Silver**: Flattening nested structures, applying business rules, data quality checks\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the data arrives as files in OneLake (not a traditional message store), Structured Streaming gives us:\n",
    "- ✅ Incremental processing (only new files)\n",
    "- ✅ Exactly-once guarantees (no duplicates)\n",
    "- ✅ Automatic restart capability (fault tolerance)\n",
    "- ✅ Scalability (handles growing data volumes)"

    "| Component | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",

    "| **Checkpointing** | Tracks progress for exactly-once processing and fault tolerance |\n",
    "| **Trigger Intervals** | How often to process new data (continuous, fixed interval, available now) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 The Streaming Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1️⃣ Read stream from source\n",
    "df = spark.readStream.format(\"json\").load(\"path/to/input\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2️⃣ Apply transformations (same as batch!)\n",
    "transformed = df.select(...).where(...).withColumn(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3️⃣ Write to Delta Lake\n",
    "query = transformed.writeStream \\\n",
    "    .format(\"delta\") \\\n",

    "```\n",

    "Congratulations! You've explored a production-grade streaming data pipeline in Microsoft Fabric. Here's what you've learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1️⃣ Spark Fundamentals\n",
    "- ✅ **DataFrame API**: Reading Parquet and JSON files\n",
    "- ✅ **Spark SQL**: Using `%%sql` magic commands and temporary views\n",
    "- ✅ **Data Exploration**: Previewing schemas and nested structures\n",
    "- ✅ **Batch vs Streaming**: Understanding the unified API\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2️⃣ Structured Streaming in Action\n",
    "- ✅ **Incremental Processing**: Only new files are processed automatically\n",
    "- ✅ **Checkpointing**: Fault-tolerant, exactly-once semantics\n",
    "- ✅ **Real-time Monitoring**: Using `.status` and `.lastProgress`\n",
    "- ✅ **Trigger Modes**: `availableNow=True` for one-time batch processing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3️⃣ Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)\n",
    "- ✅ **Bronze Zone**: Raw data preservation with audit metadata\n",
    "- ✅ **Silver Zone**: Cleaned, flattened, analytics-ready data\n",
    "- ✅ **Data Quality**: Understanding transformation at each layer\n",
    "- ✅ **Latency Monitoring**: Measuring end-to-end processing time\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4️⃣ Production Pipeline Patterns\n",
    "- ✅ **Spark Job Definitions**: Long-running, orchestrated pipelines\n",
    "- ✅ **JSON Flattening**: Handling nested structures\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎬 Your Streaming Job Status\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** Your Spark Job Definition (`StreamBronzeAndSilver`) is still running in the background!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current State:**\n",
    "- ✅ Generating synthetic data every few seconds\n",
    "- ✅ Processing Landing → Bronze → Silver continuously\n",
    "- ✅ Data accumulating in Delta tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You Can Do:**\n",
    "- 🔄 **Re-run queries** in this notebook to see growing data volumes\n",
    "- 📊 **Check the Lakehouse** to explore tables and schemas\n",
    "- ⏸️ **Stop the job** if needed (navigate to workspace → Spark Job Definition → Cancel)\n",
